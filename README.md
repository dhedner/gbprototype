# Game Boy Prototype

## Description
This project is an experiment leveraging the [ZGB engine](https://github.com/Zal0/ZGB), which expands on [GBDK 2020](https://github.com/gbdk-2020/gbdk-2020), in order to develop Game Boy games in C.

Utilizing ZGB's sprite manager and collision logic, basic functionality was built for very generic puzzle-combat behavior including block pushing and patroling enemies.
